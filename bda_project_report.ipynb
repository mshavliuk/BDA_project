    "Predicting one's heart condition is crucial for giving proper medical decisions and possibly saving lives. The misdiagnosis of heart disease may cause serious problems, as being left untreated adequately can even lead to an irreversible damage in the heart muscle and can be life-threatening. Therefore, the correct diagnosis of the heart disease status is extremely vital not only for patients’ health but also their live.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the heart disease status cannot be diagnosed easily since there are many blood vessels in the human body which lead directly to the heart and it is very expensive and time consuming to check all the blood vessels’ conditions by imaging method such as coronary angiogram. Hence, before making the decision whether or not conducting complicated examination techniques, it is important for the doctor to accurately assess the patients’ heart condition based on easily measurable biometric parameters such as age, sex, chest paint types, resting blood vessels, blood cholesterol levels, etc.\n",

    "• **Section 3** visualizes the data and relation between the features and the labels\\\n",
